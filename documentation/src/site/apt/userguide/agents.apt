Apache Kalumet Console Agents Configuration

 By clicking on the "Agents" button in the top menu, you will have a new "Agents" window.

[/images/agents_list.png]
 
 The agent configuration are stored in the console. When an agent starts, it connects to the console with an ID to get its configuration.
 It's what you define in the console.

 You have to create the configuration for each agent.

 In this agents list, you can:

 * copy an agent configuration to create a new one using this information

 * delete an agent

 * test (ping) the status of the agent

 NB: when you modify an agent, don't forget to click on "Save" button to flush and store the configuration.

 To add a new agent, click on "Add Agent" button, or you can edit an existing agent by clicking on the agent ID.

 On the agent window, using the bottom icons, you can:

 * reload the agent configuration from the store

 * delete the agent configuration

 * paste a configuration previously copied

 * check the current status of the agent

 * apply the configuration changes

 * close the agent window

 The "General" tab allows you to define the general information about an agent:

 * the ID is the agent ID that you will use at agent startup script. The agent will get the configuration corresponding to this ID.

 * the hostname is the IP address or the hostname where the agent runs. It's used by the console to interact with the agent.

 * the port is the network port number used by the agent on the machine where it runs. It's used by the console to interact with the agent.

[/images/agent_scheduler.png] 

 The "Scheduler" tab allows you to configure the scheduler embedded in the agent. The agent scheduler fires actions (like updates) on the agent.
 The scheduler configuration is compliant with the Unix cron syntax.
 
 For instance, you can use:

[/images/agent_capacity.png]

 The "Capacity" tab configure the maximum numbers of environments and JEE application servers that the agent is able to manage. It allows you to manage the server machine resources usage.
 For instance, you can setup 5 environments on a box, but "limit" the number of running environments running in the same time using the agent capacity.
