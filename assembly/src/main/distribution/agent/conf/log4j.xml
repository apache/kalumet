    Log4J Configuration Quick Reference:
    ====================================

    Priority order is DEBUG < INFO < WARN < ERROR < FATAL

    PatternLayout conversion characters:

    %c   Category of the logging event
    %C   Fully qualified class name of the caller
    %d   Date of the logging event  (example: %d{HH:mm:ss,SSS} )
    %F   File name where the logging request was issued (caution: extremely slow)
    %l   Location information of the caller (caution: extremely slow)
    %L   Line number from where the logging request was issued (caution: extremely slow)
    %m   Application-supplied message
    %M   Method name from where the logging request was issued (caution: extremely slow)
    %n   Line separator
    %p   Priority of the logging event
    %r   Number of milliseconds since the start of the application
    %t   Name of the thread that generated the logging event
    %x   Nested diagnotic context associated with the thread
    %%   A single percent sign

    Format modifiers examples:

    %20c     Left pad with spaces if category is less than 20 characters long
    %-20c    Right pad with spaces if category is less than 20 characters long
    %.30c    Truncate from the beginning if category is more than 30 chars long
    %20.30c  Left pad 20 chars + truncate from beginning if more than 30 chars
    %-20.30c Right pad 20 chars + truncate from beginning if more than 30 chars

    Examples:  "%r [%t] %-5p %c %x - %m\n"
    "%-6r [%15.15t] %-5p %30.30c %x - %m\n"
